##How to use
Install TamperMonkey in Chrome https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

I configured Chrome to only allow TamperMonkey to run when activated by the following setting
`Allow this extension to read and change all your data on websites that you visit: On click`

Then install the user script from using Dashboard > Utilities https://cbromberg.github.io/lazy-status.js

In settings choose 

Run at context-menu
On your Jira screen click TamperMonkey and then right click the Jira screen and Select TamperMonkey > lazy_status
